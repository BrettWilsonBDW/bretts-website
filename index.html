        <h1 id="mainh1">Hello there, my name is Brett Wilson and this is my personal DevBlog website.</h1>

        <div class="mainArticle">

        <p class="mainp">I have always had a fascination for computers and how they work. I enjoy problem solving and the feeling of completeness when pieces of a problem fit together. I enjoy learning new topics and being a life long learner to always advance myself forward.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 80px;" class="lastp">The creation of video games is a rather interesting topic to me, as well as the thought put behind the systems that drive them. It was then only natural I gravitated towards a attempt to learn C++. I have also studied web development along with JavaScript, html, CSS and basic programming concepts using python and c and the alike.</p>
